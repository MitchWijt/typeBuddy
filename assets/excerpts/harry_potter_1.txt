Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm re-boned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Neither Ron nor Hermione was in their own beds, but judging by the fact that there were two new bottles of armadillo bile on Harry's bedside table, they had been up at the hospital wing to see him. He checked his watch, saw that it was past midday, and hurriedly got out of bed, looking for his robes. He found them at the foot of his bed, cleaned, pressed, and patched. They looked brand-new. On a chair beside them were his wand and his empty potion bottles from Snape. Looking down, he saw he had left his Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map on the floor, and pocketed them, too. Then he headed for the door, looking around as he did so for any signs of Ron or Hermione, but there were none. He had just reached for the door handle when it turned and it opened very slowly. Expecting to see one of his friends, he leapt backward in shock when a hooded figure stepped into the room, shutting the door behind him.The lamps were lit now and Harry saw that the figure was wearing Professor Moody's clothes and carrying his large trunk, which was rattling as though full of wood - and a cage containing a giant, black beetle. The trunk heaved itself onto the bed and the beetle onto the windowsill; it was clicking its pincers excitedly, apparently very pleased to have escaped the box."Good morning, Harry," said Moody. His voice was muffled again and Harry thought it sounded as though he was wearing the Invisibility Cloak under the cloak of Moody's that he had borrowed. "Got your breakfast?" "No," said Harry.
