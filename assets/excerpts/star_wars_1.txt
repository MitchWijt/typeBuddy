At that moment, the door opened and Chewbacca peered into the room, snarling. "It's all right," Han said. "I'm not blind. We're okay." But the Wookiee just continued to stare at him, his fur bristling. Han turned to Lando. "Come on, let's get out of here." They quickly headed for the back exit. Luke moved deeper into the shadows of the throne room, watching as Vader and the Emperor strode toward the giant window. He noticed the flickering of Vader's glove and realized that his father was signaling him. He concentrated on the signal and suddenly knew what he had to do. It was a daring plan, and the odds of success were not high, but he had no other choice. Leia was rushing through the bunker, blasting at stormtroopers and trying to avoid the explosions that shook the ground beneath her feet. She was almost out of breath when she saw a narrow stairway leading up to a small, open hatch. She began to climb. At the top, she hesitated for a moment, glancing over her shoulder. The battle was still raging, but the rebels seemed to be making progress. Suddenly she felt a terrible pain in her head, and then everything went black. Vader, standing next to the Emperor at the window, suddenly sensed that Luke was in great danger. He turned toward the door, and as he did so, he felt a familiar presence. He knew that it was his son, but he could not bring himself to face him. "I see, my lord," he said slowly, his voice trembling. "I understand." "Good," the Emperor said, his voice sharp. "Then you will die as well." He raised his hand, and a bolt of lightning shot from his fingers, striking Vader squarely in the back. Vader fell forward, his body twitching, and then he lay still. Luke watched in horror as his father's body was consumed by the Emperor's lightning. He could feel the energy surging through the room, and he knew that he was the only one who could stop it.
